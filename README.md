# Pathfinder / Campus Paths

This project is a route-finding tool that generates the shortest walking route between two buildings on campus, using the Spark Framework and a React-based graphical user interface. The application utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths in a graph representation of buildings and pathways.

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`
3. Run the Spark server
4. Start the React server using `npm start`
