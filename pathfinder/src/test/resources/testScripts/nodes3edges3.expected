# Finding paths in a Graph with 3 nodes and 3 edges
# being one node linked directly to the end and other
# linked to another that links to the end.

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph

added edge 1.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from B to C in simpleGraph
added edge 3.000 from A to C in simpleGraph

path from A to C:
A to B with weight 1.000
B to C with weight 1.000
total cost: 2.000

path from A to B:
A to B with weight 1.000
total cost: 1.000

path from B to C:
B to C with weight 1.000
total cost: 1.000
