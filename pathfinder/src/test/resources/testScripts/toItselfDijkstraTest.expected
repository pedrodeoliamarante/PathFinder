# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# the path found by BFS is different.

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph

added edge 10.000 from A to B in simpleGraph

path from A to A:
A to A with weight 0.000
total cost: 0.000

path from B to B:
B to B with weight 0.000
total cost: 0.000
