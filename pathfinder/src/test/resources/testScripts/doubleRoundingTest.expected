# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# the path has labels with doubles that have a big number of decimal places

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph


added edge 0.231 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 0.400 from A to C in simpleGraph
added edge 1.760 from B to C in simpleGraph

path from A to B:
A to B with weight 0.231
total cost: 0.231

path from A to C:
A to C with weight 0.400
total cost: 0.400

path from B to C:
B to C with weight 1.760
total cost: 1.760
